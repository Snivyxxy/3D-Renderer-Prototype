# 3D-Renderer-Prototype
A rudimentary, not fully functional 3D renderer written in C++ using SDL2 and bad programming practices

Finding libraries for this project was one of the hardest parts of this project, as I wanted to use a library to interface with a computer's GPU to make rendering faster, but I ultimately didn't find a library that does such a thing. Although docs for OpenGL seem promising, learning it would take more time than I had to finish this project.
This project is not complete, and is missing various features such as clipping, filled triangles, and depth buffering.
